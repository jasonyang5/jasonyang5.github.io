Since my Nesco roaster was recalled (funny story for another time), I haven't had the chance to own 3 different fresh(ish) coffees at once until just today.  

Onto business - I tried 3 different coffees. 
1. Ethiopian Single Origin coffee from Shearwater Coffee in Westport, CT
2. Highline Blend (a light roast blend, couldn't find origin info) from Irving Farm in New York, NY
3. Decaf Guatemala from Happy Mug in Edinboro, PA


I looked for the predominant flavor, finish, and texture. 

| Item         | Primary Flavor     | Finish | Texture |
|--------------|--------------------|--------| --------|
| Shearwater Ethiopia | Jammy Fruit | Lingering Finish | Thin |
| Irving Farm Highline | Fresh Fruit | Lingering Finish | Thin |
| Happy Mug Guatemala | Nutty | Almost no finish | Thin | 

Honestly, it's still pretty hard for me to identify flavors outright. But tasting coffees comparatively makes it a lot easier. 

Main (super pretentious) difference between (1) and (2) is the fresh vs Jammy Fruit. Fresh fruit basically means an intense fruity acidity, like a slice of apple or orange. Jammy fruit means muted acidity, but still has the suggestion of fruit (not necessarily sweeter with additional sugars).
