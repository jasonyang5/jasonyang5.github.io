In the past, I've spent way too long poring over "big" life decisions. Consider this post advice to future me. To the extent you're anything like me, I encourage you to take this with at least two grains of salt. 

Run on sentence incoming: As college applications, next year internships, next year full time careers roll around, and deadlines for other long term and semi-irreversible decisions come around, I encourage you to ask yourself whether you will actually be able to know whether you made the best decision in hindsight. 

My personal answer to that question for the two "big" decisions I've made in life (college, career, friends, etc.) is a resounding no. I can say I'm mostly happy, but I have no way of knowing the alternatives. Plus, I can only tell extremely rough quartiles of my happiness and general satisfaction. Given my bias to *already* over-think big problems, the fact that the choices I'm poring over are in the top 10 mean they won't move me down a whole quartile on the happiness scale.  

Given that, I think it's better to frame decisions more like "don't screw it up" as opposed to "choose wisely". Only the *really* bad decisions - going into a college puts you into impossibly high debt, your friend stole your car - stick out in hindsight. 

Just choose randomly and enjoy your hard earned generally probably happiness (quartile 3).
