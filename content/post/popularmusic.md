For the last 20 years or so, music has gone in one ear and out the other. Last week I caught up on popular EDM artists without spotify or asking people about their favorite artists. I don't think I've fully figured everything out but made more headway last week than I have in the past 20 years.

I honestly have no idea if my assumptions or metrics make any sense but it was fun to put on the tinfoil hat and try to build up a reasonable list. For what it's worth, I recognized a song playing in my barber shop last week as Hurricane by Martin Garrix. Coming from a guy who can barely recognize a beetle this is huge. 

## Building a List of Artists
Idea: More popular artists will have more expensive and sold out concert tickets. This metric I feel pretty confident in but it was surprisingly annoying to click through every concert.  

Implementation:
1. Search the largest venues in New York City by square footage (EDM is easy because concerts happen so often)
2. Do some eyeball adjustments for artists who are playing during weekdays or sundays
3. Click through every venue and look for events that are sold out (bonus points for selling out multiple days)
4. Look at the artists on Wikipedia, if they are listed as "EDM", read through every EP including collaborations noting the other artists.

## Building a list of Popular Songs
Idea: All else equal, collab songs are more popular than isolated songs because they have more people following/looking at it. Main missing component here is that I have no idea how to determine if a solo song is popular, though my completely unqualified opinion says they would not have as broad a reach as a collaboration with a popular vocalist.

Implementaiton:
1. Within an artist, click through every song and EP noting collab artists and making a list
2. For each collab artist, look that collab artist on wikipedia
3. Sort the collab artists by number of words on their wikipedia page

## Finds
So far, I've clicked through the Brooklyn Mirage page and every artist/EP combo. My sense is that the below 4 artists are the most popular (in no particular order)

* Martin Garrix (sold out 4 days, concert tickets are $200, I'll go out on a limb and say this guy is probably the most popular of the list)
* Galantis
* Gordo (pretty expensive tickets for a Sunday concert that starts at 4pm)
* Louis the Child

And the below songs are the most popular

* In the name of love
* Scared to be lonely
* Ocean
* Left and Right (the BTS collab might be skewing this here)

## Concluding thoughts
Coming up with a notion of popular without actually talking to people or observing something like number of spotify listens was a surprisingly annoying and manual process, but hopefully I came up with something directionally right. Let me know if you think those songs are completely off base. In a subsequent post I'll align my finds against spotify listens to really compare.
