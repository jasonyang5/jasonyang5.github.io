summary: SBF's fraud does not implicate my conception of Effective Altruism because I do not think he was actually an effective altruist.

# Intro to new Blog Category
I'm adding a new category called "Takes". For context, I enjoy taking time to think about my decisions, my process for making decisions, and how that relates to new info out in the world. Sometimes, this produces a hot take. These posts force me to organize that thinking and hopefully will provide entertainment for others. I try make reasonable claims most of the time, but mostly this is an exercise in logical thinking based on my experiences rather than researching to find out what's true. 

# Summary
I don’t believe true effective altruists can hold billions of dollars for themselves (even if it’s not cash and in some less liquid asset ie stock needed to keep ownership). 

Effective altruism is fairly broad with many interpretations. I think effective altruists seek to sustainably maximize well being for those they believe have moral relevance. I add sustainable because most people (myself included) wouldn't be interested in being effective altruists if doing so came at the expense of their whole life.  

In this post, I consider two potential justifications for holding a billion dollars in assets. 1) that it's part of a broader earning to give strategy and 2) that it's needed to maintain decision rights of an impactful company. 

# Earning to Give
Altruists that are earning to give make a choice between the following options: 
* Cause A
* Cause B
* Cause C
* ...
* Keeping the money 

Let's break this down into 2 sub choices: choosing between keeping the money and donating and choosing between the many causes to donate to. 

**Keeping vs Donating**

I see the choice between donating and keeping driven by 2 main points
1. Improving sustainability of future giving (buying food, basic hobbies, basic socialization, or capital investment)
2. Preference 

Intuitively, effective altruists are more defined by their preference between donating and keeping money after adjusting for the fact that there is some reasonable amount they have to spend on themselves so they don't go insane.  

This feels obvious to me, but I'll say that holding on to a billion dollars cannot possibly be justified by food, hobbies, and socialization. Even having multiple comically expensive hobbies like buying a new ferrari every 2 months, 20 haute coture dresses at Paris fashion week, and a golf membership at Augusta National Golf Club each year only sums to ~$3m per year (meaning you could set aside 15% of that $1b for yourself and donate the rest while sustaining "basic hobbies and socialization needs"). A billion dollars is a lot. 

Capital investment could warrant keeping money for yourself. Suppose you're a entrepreneurial visionary and put out a good number of bangers every year and earn well over 20% per year on that capital. Then, why not just keep doing that and then donate a lump sum? 

First, that type of donation profile isn't particularly sustainable and puts the job of efficient financing and investing through time on the nonprofits. This is problematic because the typical nonprofit has a bad investment opportunity set for transferring wealth into the future (no space in the top VC, hedge fund, private equity allocations) and an even worse one for taking wealth from the future (no capitalization, greater risk of default resulting in expensive loans). 

Second, it's fairly undemocratic. This mode of donation makes the EA agenda concentrated in the hands of a few "key moments" and "key players". It seems fair to say that a few people (whether or not they happen to be billionaires) are probably not representative of the entireity of the world's best thinking on important global causes. Anecdotally, it feels like billionaires (Elon Musk, SBF, Bezos, Bill Gates to an extent) tend to be focused on longtermist causes like space exploration. It's a fine and valuable, but I'm skeptical that it's the optimal allocation.

Third, does this really happen in practice? Probably not often.

**Cause A vs Cause B**

Sub choice 2 is between causes. I think causes are impossible to reason between because any unified framework that compares causes will have extremely wide error bands that make the comparison inconclusive	. 

Take a classic example - global development aid versus minimizing existential risk. Let's use the expected quality adjusted life years framework for both. This requires 3 ingredients: the number of people benefitted, the quality of life improvement for those benefitted, and the probability that the intervention works. 

Global development aid
1. Number of people benefitted - known. Just take the population of countries in question. 
2. Quality of life improvement - very difficult to compute, many conceptions of quality and several unexpected interaction terms (e.g. will development aid result in the government underinvest in its own infrastructure?)
3. Probability - more or less known if you choose a vetted charity with real research/randomized controlled trials backing the interventions. 

Existential risk
1. Number of people benefitted - mostly known. Under reasonable assumptions, you could extrapolate the number of people that survive based on how long humanity survives. This number is very very high. 
2. Quality of life improvement - basically throwing darts. Quality of life might be better than today given what we know about the past, but it could seriously turn for the worse in the long run. Who's to say some dictator doesn't take over the world in 500 years and kill everybody's quality of life for the next 500? It's really hard to reason out all the possibilities when you are thinking about the world 1,000 years in the future. 
3. Probability - hard to argue a particular intervention actually moves the needle. This is a rant for another time, but just because the intervention could possibly/concievably work does not mean it has a positive probability of working. You can have possible outcomes that have 0 probability (e.g. picking a random real number from a hat of numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1). If the intervention possibly works but probability is still 0, the expected benefit of the intervention is still 0. 

You could do this comparison for several causes and end up in a spot with false precision - you're multiplying/adding together numbers with extremely wide error bands. It's not really any less subjective than choosing on vibes. 

# Managing on an Impactful Company
Some companies have materially changed the world (e.g. Azure/AWS efficient cloud computing, Tesla forcing the industry into EV's), and maintaining material management rights over the firm requires potentially billions of dollars in stock. The key here then is the marginal benefit of a manager/planner requiring stock to make those decisions rather than an individual contributor producing the innovations where holding stock isn't actually needed. 

I have two main objections to keeping stock to drive the direction of the company. 

First, it's important to remember the objective is to generally improve well being for the world rather than just the shareholders. So, it doesn't really matter who is providing the important services but rather that someone just does it. So, it's hard to justify the marginal dollars kept/spent on taking decision rights from someone else that is probably perfectly capable of running the company. On the innovation side, it's not clear why managers are the key driver over individual contributors coming up with ideas (that don't need stock to do so). 

Second, I think innovation is the main role corporations have in producing social benefits because old ideas generally get replicated and produced more cheaply via capitalist competition. Just from looking at the major companies throughout my lifetime, they aren't doing that much in the innovation department and just come and go. I feel like it would be a lot more effective to tie up the capital driving the direction of multiple very innovative and disruptive startups.
