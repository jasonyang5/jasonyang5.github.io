The more I describe my lifestyle to others, the more I realize that living on a night schedule in a relatively high paid career is a pretty unique experience that I learned/am learning a lot from.  

## The What Is

Daily Schedule - Weekdays
| Time         | Action     |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2:10am - 3:00am | Wake up and drive to work |
| 3:00am - 7:30am | Go to work |
| 7:30am - 8:00am | Breakfast |
| 8:00am - 11:30am | Work again |
| 11:30am - 12:00pm | Lunch |
| 12:00pm - 1:30pm | Work again |
| 1:30pm - 3:00pm | Do hobbies (aka cook dinner) |
| 3:00pm - 3:30pm | Dinner |
| 3:30pm - 6:00pm | Distract my friends and girlfriend from getting actual work done |

The Weekend is quite a bit more flexible. I could wake up anytime between ~3am and ~7am depending on how late I stayed up. Generally speaking I'll try to make plans and hang out from ~11:00am to ~6:00pm. 

Practically this means two differences from normal life
* Intersection with others gets reduced by ~50% on weekends and ~90%+ on weekdays
* Intersection with yourself increases to fill the gap
