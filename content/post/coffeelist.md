This year I've wanted to build my palate so I can identify differences across single origin coffees. So here's my list so far:

* Colombia
* Brazil (Dry Process)
* Guatemala Huehuetenago / Antigua
* Burundi
* Ethiopia (Washed, Natural)
* Sumatra
* Peru
* India
* Bali
* Honduras

I pulled this list from some combination of Sweet Maria's (a site that ships unroasted coffee) most popular list and the most common origins I've seen on coffee roaster websites.

So far, I've liked washed Colombian coffees the best - they're super mellow and easy to drink a ton of both in filter and espresso.
