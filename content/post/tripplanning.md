## Set Up
At the highest level, the basic problem for trip planning is presenting an idea to multiple stakeholders and requiring *unanimous* buy in.
The rest is operational (e.g. booking flights, hotels, charging people, etc.). 

This difficulty scales significantly with the number of people you're trying to get on board. 

I think there are just two (conflicting) goals for trip planning
1. Maximize attendance
2. Achieve some specific itinerary (e.g. target a specific time - like the two weeks of off time you have between work projects - or target a specific location - like "I want to go to Europe"). 

I think for both goals the conceptual map is the same, but the time spent and order for each step is slightly different

## General Steps
I'll preface this by saying the plan is obvious. The hard part is holding others and yourself accountable to the plan. You will have to annoy people to get the planning over the line - just tell yourself it's for everyone's good to do this and you won't feel so bad being such a bother. 

The explicit steps are
* Get in sync on the goal of the trip. 
* If the goal is to maximize attendance: 
	- Plan the date far-ish in advance (3-6mo). Takes 1-2 weeks. 
	- Plan the location/itinerary - generally some combination of cutting through by unliaterally picking stuff yourself and getting some suggestions from the group. Takes 1-2 weeks. 
	- Manage prerequisites (e.g. passports). Takes a few days to a week. 
	- Do the booking. Takes 1 day.  
* If the goal is to go somewhere cool
	- Pick the location and itinerary first
	- Plan the date, roughly lining up with who would be most interested in the location
	- Manage prerequisites. Takes a few days to a week. 
	- Do the booking. Takes 1 day. 

### Picking a date
For picking a date, the most important thing is keeping organized and minimizing the number of back and forths. Delays will come from not being explicit in what you want people to say (e.g. preferences vs hard conflicts) and not providing enough options (so you have to send out additional polls). 

Lay out a several options - more for bigger groups - and make them choose. If there are a lot of people (i.e. more than 5), you can't really manage preferences so only have people list weeks/days they *can't* go. 

### Picking a location
Within this sub-step there are 2 points
* Getting ideas
* Making people pick out of the ideas

Get ideas by just being a normal human being and talking to group members about what they want to do. No magic here. 

Making people choose is conceptually no different than picking a date. So I'd just read the above section and substitute picking a date with picking among ideas.
