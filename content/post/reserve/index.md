In my trip to Seattle, I picked up a bag of whiskey barrel aged coffee from the Starbucks Reserve. It is definitely unlike any coffee I've tasted so far (not good or bad, but very unique). 

## Smell
The first thing I noticed from the coffee was the smell. Yes, all coffees you smell first, but this smell was intense. If you told me the roaster sprayed the bag with a vanilla-whiskey perfume, I'd believe you. 

## Visual
The roast was on the darker side with a good amount of coffee oils. The color was quite even throughout. 

## Taste and Brew
With this coffee, I had to experiment with a couple techniques. Judging from the dark roast and strong flavors, I thought it would be best suited to Aeropress and French Press. Starbucks also suggests cold brew. 

Aeropress Recipe - standard 
* 14g coffee
* 220g water
* Fine - medium/fine grind (a bit finer than a single cup v60)
* 1 pour, stirring once at the end
* Steep for 4 minutes (using the plunger to create a vacuum and stall the drawdown)
* Press very gently for about 1 minute

I tasted a baseline of chocolate with some caramel/vanilla flavoring (definitely influenced by smell). No fruit notes at all, likely roasted out or overpowered by the barrel flavor. Fairly rich mouthfeel - the body felt representative of a typical guatemalan single origin.
I tried cooling the brew down in the refrigerator, which muted a lot of the chocolate flavors. This left  behind only a vanilla/caramel extract flavor that I thought was quite unsatisfying compared to the hot aeropress. Other coffees usually taste more sour after cooling down, which I didn't notice in this coffee at all. 

French Press Recipe - also standard

## General Conclusions
Overall, definitely a unique coffee style. 
Even if it were 1/4 the price and feasible for everyday consumption, I wouldn't advise. The smells (and by extension, taste) were too overwhelming for me. I personally like coffees that are simpler and easier to drink.
