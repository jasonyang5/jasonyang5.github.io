\subsection{How the business works}\label{how-the-business-works}}

At a high level, the coinbase revenue is Revenue =
RetailTransactionVolume * Fees Transaction fees are 95\% of their
revenue

Their costs are in line with any other growthy tech business - lots of
tech investment to build out the platform and lots of sales and
marketing. Nothing out of the ordinary, although they took their
positive profits from last year and are heavily investing this year \&
will have negative profits for the next few quarters.

\hypertarget{current-market-pricing}{%
\subsection{Current Market Pricing}\label{current-market-pricing}}

Right now, market pricing is far from fundamentals because it is
currently priced as `BTC Up Or Down', rather than as a function of
crypto volumes on the platform. The correlation to BTC price is 0.7,
correlation to SPX is about 0.5 over the last year.

The 2022Q1 earnings report was a heavy ``surprise'' to the downside
because Crypto volumes were down, which compressed the top line. But,
the fact that crypto volumes were down YTD was no secret - you can
literally just look at BTC volume chart and see that.

The fact that the crypto market as a whole is going down right now is
causing Coinbase to go down as well due to that priced in correlation -
they are down something like 70\% from the IPO and down
\textasciitilde50\% over the past month. But, BTC volumes are up - this
is a common thing across almost all markets, when volatilities goes up
volumes go up and crypto is no different.

\hypertarget{catalyst}{%
\subsection{Catalyst}\label{catalyst}}

One short term, one long term catalyst. 1. Earnings - they report that
revenue is up because volumes are up, causing the price to go up in the
short term (but potentially revert in line with btc price) 2. Market
Players will Change - right now, a very high \% of holders of Coinbase
are not `fundamental' players but rather people looking to be long
Crypto as a whole but either cannot or will not invest in spot crypto
(e.g.~most institutional managers) or ETF's that track the broader
crypto and meme stocks (e.g.~ARKK innovation fund, the largest owner of
coinbase at the moment). Within the next 1-2 years, there will be an
increase in fundamental value investor coverage in this space which will
make the price converge to be priced in line with volume rather than BTC
price.
