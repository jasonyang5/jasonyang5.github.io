title: "About Me"
---
Hi Everyone! I’m Jason Yang, an Econ/Math grad from The University of Chicago. Currently, I work at Bridgewater Associates (a hedge fund) in the Futures and FX trade execution team.

I’ve produced some (probably definitely mediocre) research in Financial Economics as an Undergrad and follow articles published in top economics and finance research journals. I now roast and brew single origin coffees from around the world and spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about personal finance and taxes.

I have the blog divided by Category and Tag. The categories and tags aren’t well defined at the moment, but I hope to make them more informative as I go on.

None of the links on this site are affiliate links. I am not an influencer (yet?), I just like writing as a way to spend time and organize my thoughts.
