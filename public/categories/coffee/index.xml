      <description>I was surprised to find a bag of beans from Ethiopia Yirgacheffe roasted yesterday at a local roastery (Kusanya Cafe) at Whole Foods. The beans had a very smooth mouthfeel and were very bright and fruity.
I tried V60 first with the tabbed &amp;amp; bleached paper filters. The coffee felt quite thin but definitely not lacking in personality.
The Clever Dripper with a cloth filter tasted similar but had a much fuller body (which I personally prefer) because of the additional dissolved oils.</description>

      <title>Nesco Roasting Guide and Review</title>

      <description>I got a great deal on a Nesco roaster ($45 for an open-box product, normally $80) and figured it would be great value at that price. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.
Pricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to buy it at full price ($80).</description>
