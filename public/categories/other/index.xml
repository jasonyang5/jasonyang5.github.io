      <description>Credit card blogs love to recommend buying first class flights abroad to get the most &amp;lsquo;value&amp;rsquo; out of your points, citing 2 to 5 cents per point in some cases.
I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got them beat. Try 9 cents per point for a United Economy flight to Shanghai next April&amp;hellip;
Cash Flights: NYC to Shanghai in April 2022 United Miles Flights NYC to Shanghai in April 2022 The Bonus Rant: It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in credit card marketing with their crazy miles valuations, sometimes citing the best case with crazy expensive international flight redemptions.</description>

      <title>Condorcet&#39;s Paradox in Political Science (Part 1)</title>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Condorcet Paradox&amp;rdquo; in political science observes that even if the preferences of all the individuals in some society are &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo;, the preferences of the group may not be1. Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.
I thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time?</description>

      <description>General Impressions Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book called &amp;ldquo;Analyzing Politics&amp;rdquo; by Kenneth A Shepsle, which introduces rational models in political science. Rational models seek to explain political behavior (e.g. group voting, legislation, etc.) using individuals with &amp;ldquo;rational preferences&amp;rdquo;. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve waded through an economics major, I felt at home with this book&amp;rsquo;s treatment of the subject. My next few blog posts will cover a few topics I found interesting.</description>
