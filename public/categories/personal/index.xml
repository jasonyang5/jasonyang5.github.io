      <description>In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent way too long poring over &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; life decisions. Consider this post advice to future me. To the extent you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, I encourage you to take this with at least two grains of salt.
Run on sentence incoming: As college applications, next year internships, next year full time careers roll around, and deadlines for other long term and semi-irreversible decisions come around, I encourage you to ask yourself whether you will actually be able to know whether you made the best decision in hindsight.</description>

      <description>Set Up At the highest level, the basic problem for trip planning is presenting an idea to multiple stakeholders and requiring unanimous buy in. The rest is operational (e.g. booking flights, hotels, charging people, etc.).
This difficulty scales significantly with the number of people you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get on board.
I think there are just two (conflicting) goals for trip planning
 Maximize attendance Achieve some specific itinerary (e.g. target a specific time - like the two weeks of off time you have between work projects - or target a specific location - like &amp;ldquo;I want to go to Europe&amp;rdquo;).</description>
