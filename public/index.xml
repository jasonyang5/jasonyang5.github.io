      <description>Some of you might be interested in what finance theory has to say about saving and investing. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover a classic model for portfolio choice and what we can learn from it.
TLDR  Judge assets on a risk-adjusted basis. Many managers get free press for &amp;ldquo;significantly beating the market&amp;rdquo;(20%-30% returns per year), these returns aren&amp;rsquo;t that special if their performance is a lot more volatile than the market.</description>

      <description>TLDR  Crypto is popular Investors can get high returns by lending out cryptocurrencies, but they take on credit risk and currency risk. Everyday people have no shot of accessing that risk because they don&amp;rsquo;t own commercial banks. So, this form of lending may have a minor role in diversifying an investment portfolio.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of buzz on crypto. News: commonly read finance news like Bloomberg now reports Crypto as its own section</description>

      <description>Credit card blogs love to recommend buying first class flights abroad to get the most &amp;lsquo;value&amp;rsquo; out of your points, citing 2 to 5 cents per point in some cases.
I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got them beat. Try 9 cents per point for a United Economy flight to Shanghai next April&amp;hellip;
Cash Flights: NYC to Shanghai in April 2022 United Miles Flights NYC to Shanghai in April 2022 The Bonus Rant: It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in credit card marketing with their crazy miles valuations, sometimes citing the best case with crazy expensive international flight redemptions.</description>

      <title>Odyssey Blend</title>

      <description>Starbucks released a new blend called the Odyssey Blend. To be honest, I bought the coffee because I thought the bag looked nice.
It even inspired a silly little design in my bullet journal.
Luckily for me, the coffee was reasonably fresh (hard to guarantee at Starbucks b/c of no roast dates). When I brewed the beans, the slurry bloomed quite a bit.
The coffee is also roasted surprisingly light, especially compared to other starbucks blends.</description>

      <title>Condorcet&#39;s Paradox in Political Science (Part 1)</title>
      <link>https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/condrocetcycles/</link>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Condorcet Paradox&amp;rdquo; in political science observes that even if the preferences of all the individuals in some society are &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo;, the preferences of the group may not be1. Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.
I thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time?</description>

      <title>Analyzing Politics Review</title>

      <description>General Impressions Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book called &amp;ldquo;Analyzing Politics&amp;rdquo; by Kenneth A Shepsle, which introduces rational models in political science. Rational models seek to explain political behavior (e.g. group voting, legislation, etc.) using individuals with &amp;ldquo;rational preferences&amp;rdquo;. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve waded through an economics major, I felt at home with this book&amp;rsquo;s treatment of the subject. My next few blog posts will cover a few topics I found interesting.</description>

      <description>About Me Hi Everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m Jason Yang, an Econ/Math grad from The University of Chicago. Currently, I work at Bridgewater Associates (a hedge fund) in the Futures and FX trade execution team.
I&amp;rsquo;ve produced some (probably definitely mediocre) research in Financial Economics as an Undergrad and follow articles published in top economics and finance research journals. I now roast and brew single origin coffees from around the world and spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about personal finance and taxes.</description>

      <title>Local Ethiopia Yirgacheffe</title>

      <description>I was surprised to find a bag of beans from Ethiopia Yirgacheffe roasted yesterday at a local roastery (Kusanya Cafe) at Whole Foods. The beans had a very smooth mouthfeel and were very bright and fruity.
I tried V60 first with the tabbed &amp;amp; bleached paper filters. The coffee felt quite thin but definitely not lacking in personality.
The Clever Dripper with a cloth filter tasted similar but had a much fuller body (which I personally prefer) because of the additional dissolved oils.</description>

      <title>Nesco Roasting Guide and Review</title>
      <link>https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/nesco/</link>

      <description>I got a great deal on a Nesco roaster ($45 for an open-box product, normally $80) and figured it would be great value at that price. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.
Pricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to buy it at full price ($80).</description>
