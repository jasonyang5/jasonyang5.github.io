      <description>Starbucks released a new blend called the Odyssey Blend. To be honest, I bought the coffee because I thought the bag looked nice.
It even inspired a silly little design in my bullet journal.
Luckily for me, the coffee was reasonably fresh (hard to guarantee at Starbucks b/c of no roast dates). When I brewed the beans, the slurry bloomed quite a bit.
The coffee is also roasted surprisingly light, especially compared to other starbucks blends.</description>

      <title>Local Ethiopia Yirgacheffe</title>

      <description>I was surprised to find a bag of beans from Ethiopia Yirgacheffe roasted yesterday at a local roastery (Kusanya Cafe) at Whole Foods. The beans had a very smooth mouthfeel and were very bright and fruity.
I tried V60 first with the tabbed &amp;amp; bleached paper filters. The coffee felt quite thin but definitely not lacking in personality.
The Clever Dripper with a cloth filter tasted similar but had a much fuller body (which I personally prefer) because of the additional dissolved oils.</description>
