      <description>This year I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to build my palate so I can identify differences across single origin coffees. So here&amp;rsquo;s my list so far:
 Colombia Brazil (Dry Process) Guatemala Huehuetenago / Antigua Burundi Ethiopia (Washed, Natural) Sumatra Peru India Bali Honduras  I pulled this list from some combination of Sweet Maria&amp;rsquo;s (a site that ships unroasted coffee) most popular list and the most common origins I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on coffee roaster websites.</description>

      <description>These two points are more indicative of my personal preference and situation, more than anything else.
There were 2 main drivers for me:
 Consistency and ease of use Fast heat up time  Consistency and ease of use go hand in hand. The dial-in process requires a ton of time, effort, and (now increasingly expensive&amp;hellip;) coffee. Ideally, you dial-in like a science experiment - change one variable and evaluate the output.</description>

      <description>Since my Nesco roaster was recalled (funny story for another time), I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to own 3 different fresh(ish) coffees at once until just today.
Onto business - I tried 3 different coffees.
 Ethiopian Single Origin coffee from Shearwater Coffee in Westport, CT Highline Blend (a light roast blend, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find origin info) from Irving Farm in New York, NY Decaf Guatemala from Happy Mug in Edinboro, PA  I looked for the predominant flavor, finish, and texture.</description>

      <title>Nesco Review</title>

      <description>I got a great deal on a Nesco roaster ($45 for an open-box product, normally $80) and figured it would be great value at that price. I’ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.
I’ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.
Pricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won’t have to buy it at full price ($80).</description>
