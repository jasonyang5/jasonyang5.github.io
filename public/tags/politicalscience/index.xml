      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Condorcet Paradox&amp;rdquo; in political science observes that even if the preferences of all the individuals in some society are &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo;, the preferences of the group may not be1. Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.
I thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time?</description>

      <description>General Impressions Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book called &amp;ldquo;Analyzing Politics&amp;rdquo; by Kenneth A Shepsle, which introduces rational models in political science. Rational models seek to explain political behavior (e.g. group voting, legislation, etc.) using individuals with &amp;ldquo;rational preferences&amp;rdquo;. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve waded through an economics major, I felt at home with this book&amp;rsquo;s treatment of the subject. My next few blog posts will cover a few topics I found interesting.</description>
