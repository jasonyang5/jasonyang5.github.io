[{"content":"The \u0026ldquo;Condorcet Paradox\u0026rdquo; in political science observes that even if the preferences of all the individuals in some society are \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo;, the preferences of the group may not be1. Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.\nI thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time? This puzzle motivated me to investigate this phenomenon using some math and computation.\nAssumptions  Individuals have preferences which are independently and uniformly distributed among the set of all possible rational preferences The group preference is determined by a head-to-head method of voting. The group prefers \\(p_1\\) to \\(p_2\\) if in a head-to-head vote \\(p_1\\) gets more votes than \\(p_2\\).  Computational Procedure Here are the basic steps:\n Generate a random set of rational preferences (individuals that will vote) Generate a group preference by head to head voting Check if the group preference is \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; Repeat 1-3 200 times, and report the percentage of preferences which are rational  My solution to the problem is actually quite inefficient. There is probably a way to compute this algebraically using basic combinatorics, but I was too lazy. Plus, the computational solution to step 3 is actually related to some fundamental CS concepts.\nComputation Results The figure below shows the estimated percent of consistent preferences. Yellow means almost 100% chance of consistent preferences, green means about 67%, blue 33%, and purple 0%.\nIncreasing the number of policies has the greatest effect on the percent of consistent group preferences. By the time the group is considering 9 different alternatives, the percentage of consistent preferences is essentially zero. Increasing number of people seems to only have a weak effect.\nA Specific Example of Inconsistent Group Preference What causes the inconsistency? I hope this example will be illustrative.\nFigure 1 shows a network representation of the group\u0026rsquo;s preferences. We draw an arrow from 1 -\u0026gt; 2 if the group prefers 1 to 2. Here we can see a clear cycle between 5, 2, and 1. This violates preference transitivity, because the group prefers 5 to 2 and 2 to 1, but does not prefer 5 to 1.\nThe reason behind the cycle is quite intuitive. Table 1 shows that a different \u0026ldquo;majority\u0026rdquo; voted for each pairwise competition. This kind of behavior happens all the time when there is imperfect intersection of interest groups.\nFigure 1: Network of Group Preferences Table 1: Table of Majorities (in the Cycle)\n   First Option Second Option Voters     5 2 A, B   1 2 A, C   1 5 B, C    To contrast rational preferences with inconsistent preferences, I\u0026rsquo;ve also included a network representation of voter A in figure 2. For voter A, each option has a different number of arrows pointing to it. This closely relates to ranked list preference: the best option has arrows pointing everywhere else, second best preferred has arrows pointing everywhere except the best, et cetera. This does not hold in Figure 1, as choices 5, 2 and 1 all have 2 arrows pointing into them.\nFigure 2: Network of Voter A\u0026rsquo;s Preferences I\u0026rsquo;ve also the list of individual ranked preferences generating figure 1 in Table 2 (at the end of the post).\nImplications for Voting In cases where the number of alternatives is small, we get consistent group preferences most of the time. So when voting between 3 or 4 alternatives (e.g. the presidential election, senate \u0026amp; house races, where to eat dinner), there really isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a problem.\nHowever, there are plenty of cases where the number of alternatives is pretty high. For example, legislators consider hundreds of different policies. This model of voting tells us it is very unlikely that the legislators as a group have rational preferences. So, the outcome of the vote depends a lot on voting rules and other mechanics of how the vote is conducted.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Assumption Relaxation. The model and its predictions are only as good as its assumptions. In my next blog post about Condorcet\u0026rsquo;s Paradox, I will try relaxing assumption 1 (that individuals are independently and uniformly distributed over the set of rational preferences).\nAfter all, seems nonsensical to assume that individuals form their beliefs independently. The fact that people regularly interact, consume similar media and information probably suggests that people have pretty correlated beliefs.\nFurthermore, peoples' preferences probably aren\u0026rsquo;t uniformly distributed over the space of policies. I would expect that the preferences are pretty clustered. For example, legislators identifying as \u0026lsquo;fiscal conservatives\u0026rsquo; probably rate all kinds of welfare spending at the bottom of their preference list. It would be rather strange if a senator put childcare spending first and then education spending last. But this model implies that such a lawmaker is fairly common!\nThis also isn\u0026rsquo;t original research. There are plenty of papers on this topic which I include at the end of the post (which I\u0026rsquo;ve read to varying degrees of completeness).\nThe Math Notation and Definitions Notation: let \\(I\\) be the set of individuals, \\(P\\) the set of policies under consideration, let \\( \u0026gt;_{i} \\) be the preference relation for person \\(i\\in I\\), and \\(\u0026gt;_g\\) be the preference relation for the group\nDefinition of Rationality:\nWe say that a preference relation \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) over a finite set of policies \\(P\\) is rational if \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) satisfies the following\n \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) is complete: For every \\(p_1, p_2 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_2, p_1 \\tilde{=} p_2, \\text{ or } p_1 \\tilde{\u0026lt;} p_2\\) \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) is transitive: For every \\(p_1, p_2, p_3 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_2 \\text{ and } p_2 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_3 \\implies p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_3\\)  Definition of \\(\u0026gt;_g\\):\nFor any \\(p_1, p_2 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \u0026gt;_g p_2\\) iff \\(|\\{i: p_1 \u0026gt;_i p_2\\}| \u0026gt; \\frac{|P|}{2}\\)\nAsssumptions The key assumption is that individual preferences are independently and uniformly distributed over the set of possible rational preferences.\nUniformity means that, if \\(S_p\\) is the set of possible rational preferences over \\(p\\), then the odds of a n individual having preference ordering (\u0026gt;_i) is given by $$\\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_i) = \\frac{1}{|S_p|}$$\nIndependence means that for any set of preference relations \\(\u0026gt;_1, \u0026hellip;, \u0026gt;_n\\) we have that $$\\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_1, \\dots, \u0026gt;_n) = \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_1) \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_2) \u0026hellip; \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_n) $$\nFor the purposes of this exercise, I represent a rational preference relation by a permutation on \\(P\\). This permutation shows the ranked preference of the individual.2\nDetermining if a preference relation is \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; Earlier I alluded to the connection between preferences and a \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; (or a Graph, in Computer Science). The definition of rational preferences is secretly the definition of a total ordering over a set. So, checking whether a group preference is rational simply amounts to checking if the group preference is a total ordering over the policy choice set.\nI talked to my more computationally-talented friends, and a simple way to solve this problem is to encode the preference into a directed graph with an edge i-\u0026gt;j if i is preferred to j. Then, check whether the directed graph has a cycle.3\nAdditional Figures and Tables List of Individual Preferences\n   Preference A Preference B Preference C     3 2 5   2 4 2   4 5 1   1 1 4   5 3 3    Network of Voter B\u0026rsquo;s Preferences Network of Voter C\u0026rsquo;s Preferences Additional Articles Tangian, A.

I\u0026rsquo;ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.\nPricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won\u0026rsquo;t have to buy it at full price ($80). At the time of writing, it went for $60 on Wayfair 4 times. You can also find it on Sweet Maria\u0026rsquo;s for $80 with 4lbs of free green beans included, worth \u0026gt;=$20.\nProduct Explanation The Nesco runs in 3 steps if you don\u0026rsquo;t interrupt it\n You put in the coffee \u0026amp; press the medium or dark button The roast cycle runs for 18 minutes (for both roast settings)  The dark setting runs at a higher temperature   The cool cycle runs for 2 minutes  Roasting Tips  Roast \u0026lt;3oz at a time. They recommend 4oz on the box, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the roast is very inconsistent with large batches I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend using the Dark setting  The roasts are less consistent due to the higher earlier roast temperatures. Since the Nesco does not sufficiently agitate the coffee while roasting, the beans near the walls will be darker than the beans in the center. (This doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen if you roast for the full cycle) The medium roast on the full 18m cycle already goes well into a French Roast, so the dark setting seems like overkill   If you can spare it, put your beans through a full roast cycle to get a sense of when each phase of the roast starts Check that the roaster is fully closed before roasting (lightly lift the cap and make sure the cap doesn\u0026rsquo;t come off) to avoid temperature loss  When I didn\u0026rsquo;t do this, the timings below could be off by more than 15 seconds. Since the roast develops very quickly after the first crack, this could easily throw your recipes off.   On average, these were the average timings for 4 different bean origins  14m40s-14m50s: short rolling first crack (popcorn sounds) - light roast, but not drinkable yet 15m20s-15m40s: longer rolling first crack (more popcorn sounds) - light medium to medium 16m20s-16m30s: short rolling second crack (snappy sounds) - medium to medium/dark roast 17m00s: long rolling second crack (loud snappy sounds) - french roast territory   I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend roasting city roasts using this machine  I haven\u0026rsquo;t tasted crispness in coffees taken 15-30s after of first crack (explanation below) The Nesco raises the temperature of the roast chamber very slowly in order to roast evenly without having to power a huge fan that blows the raw coffee around in the early stages of the roast. This makes the machine cheap and easy to run, but you lose th eability to produce good light roasts.
