The dial-in process requires a ton of time, effort, and (now increasingly expensive\u0026hellip;) coffee. Ideally, you dial-in like a science experiment - change one variable and evaluate the output. The machine controls a ton of those variables: temperature of the water, temperature of the group, pressure, water dispersion, among other things. The BDB (not that special for a machine in its price point) is well known to manage all of the above quite consistently from brew to brew.\nThe fast heat up time actually broke the tie for me between the BDB and the other machines. Unbelievably, dual boilers that heat up in a reasonable amount of time are few and far between. This is because home machines, generally borrowing from their commercial counterparts, usually rely on having large boilers to heat up the group head passively or churn water through the group head. These are great at maintaining consistent temps in a relatively \u0026lsquo;stupid\u0026rsquo; and reliable manner, which probably cuts down on Cafe maintenance costs. This method is incredibly wasteful if you heat up a huge amount of water to brew 1 40ml shot of espresso.\nThe BDB is one of few that directly heat the group head electrically - here\u0026rsquo;s the design below (pretty neat).\nYou can see that the group head above the portafilter is directly heated by a coil.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard of other machines that do this - like the Bezzra BZ10. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any supply of it anywhere, so I just went with the Breville and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy about my choice.\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/favoritecoffees_3_12_22/","summary":"These two points are more indicative of my personal preference and situation, more than anything else.\nThere were 2 main drivers for me:\n Consistency and ease of use Fast heat up time  Consistency and ease of use go hand in hand.

I’ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.\nI’ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.\nPricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won’t have to buy it at full price ($80). At the time of writing, it went for $60 on Wayfair 4 times. You can also find it on Sweet Maria’s for $80 with 4lbs of free green beans included, worth \u0026gt;=$20. Product Explanation\nThe Nesco runs in 3 steps if you don’t interrupt it\n You put in the coffee \u0026amp; press the medium or dark button The roast cycle runs for 18 minutes (for both roast settings) The dark setting runs at a higher temperature The cool cycle runs for 2 minutes  Roasting Tips  Roast \u0026lt;3oz at a time. They recommend 4oz on the box, but I’ve found that the roast is very inconsistent with large batches I wouldn’t recommend using the Dark setting   The roasts are less consistent due to the higher earlier roast temperatures. Since the Nesco does not sufficiently agitate the coffee while roasting, the beans near the walls will be darker than the beans in the center. (This doesn’t happen if you roast for the full cycle) The medium roast on the full 18m cycle already goes well into a French Roast, so the dark setting seems like overkill If you can spare it, put your beans through a full roast cycle to get a sense of when each phase of the roast starts Check that the roaster is fully closed before roasting (lightly lift the cap and make sure the cap doesn’t come off) to avoid temperature loss  When I didn’t do this, the timings below could be off by more than 15 seconds. Since the roast develops very quickly after the first crack, this could easily throw your recipes off.   On average, these were the average timings for 4 different bean origins  14m40s-14m50s: short rolling first crack (popcorn sounds) - light roast, but not drinkable yet 15m20s-15m40s: longer rolling first crack (more popcorn sounds) - light medium to medium 16m20s-16m30s: short rolling second crack (snappy sounds) - medium to medium/dark roast 17m00s: long rolling second crack (loud snappy sounds) - french roast territory   I wouldn’t recommend roasting city roasts using this machine  I haven’t tasted crispness in coffees taken 15-30s after of first crack (explanation below) The Nesco raises the temperature of the roast chamber very slowly in order to roast evenly without having to power a huge fan that blows the raw coffee around in the early stages of the roast. This makes the machine cheap and easy to run, but you lose th eability to produce good light roasts.
