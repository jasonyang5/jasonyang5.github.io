[{"content":"Intro to new Blog Category I\u0026rsquo;m adding a new category called \u0026ldquo;Takes\u0026rdquo;. For context, I enjoy taking time to think about my decisions, my process for making decisions, and how that relates to new info out in the world. Sometimes, this produces a hot take. These posts force me to organize that thinking and hopefully will provide entertainment for others. I try make reasonable claims most of the time, but mostly this is an exercise in logical thinking based on my experiences rather than researching to find out what\u0026rsquo;s true.\nSummary I don’t believe true effective altruists can hold billions of dollars for themselves (even if it’s not cash and in some less liquid asset ie stock needed to keep ownership).\nEffective altruism is fairly broad with many interpretations. I think effective altruists seek to sustainably maximize well being for those they believe have moral relevance. I add sustainable because most people (myself included) wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be interested in being effective altruists if doing so came at the expense of their whole life.\nIn this post, I consider two potential justifications for holding a billion dollars in assets. 1) that it\u0026rsquo;s part of a broader earning to give strategy and 2) that it\u0026rsquo;s needed to maintain decision rights of an impactful company.\nEarning to Give Altruists that are earning to give make a choice between the following options:\n Cause A Cause B Cause C \u0026hellip; Keeping the money  Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down into 2 sub choices: choosing between keeping the money and donating and choosing between the many causes to donate to.\nKeeping vs Donating\nI see the choice between donating and keeping driven by 2 main points\n Improving sustainability of future giving (buying food, basic hobbies, basic socialization, or capital investment) Preference  Intuitively, effective altruists are more defined by their preference between donating and keeping money after adjusting for the fact that there is some reasonable amount they have to spend on themselves so they don\u0026rsquo;t go insane.\nThis feels obvious to me, but I\u0026rsquo;ll say that holding on to a billion dollars cannot possibly be justified by food, hobbies, and socialization. Even having multiple comically expensive hobbies like buying a new ferrari every 2 months, 20 haute coture dresses at Paris fashion week, and a golf membership at Augusta National Golf Club each year only sums to ~$3m per year (meaning you could set aside 15% of that $1b for yourself and donate the rest while sustaining \u0026ldquo;basic hobbies and socialization needs\u0026rdquo;). A billion dollars is a lot.\nCapital investment could warrant keeping money for yourself. Suppose you\u0026rsquo;re a entrepreneurial visionary and put out a good number of bangers every year and earn well over 20% per year on that capital. Then, why not just keep doing that and then donate a lump sum?\nFirst, that type of donation profile isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly sustainable and puts the job of efficient financing and investing through time on the nonprofits. This is problematic because the typical nonprofit has a bad investment opportunity set for transferring wealth into the future (no space in the top VC, hedge fund, private equity allocations) and an even worse one for taking wealth from the future (no capitalization, greater risk of default resulting in expensive loans).\nSecond, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly undemocratic. This mode of donation makes the EA agenda concentrated in the hands of a few \u0026ldquo;key moments\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;key players\u0026rdquo;. It seems fair to say that a few people (whether or not they happen to be billionaires) are probably not representative of the entireity of the world\u0026rsquo;s best thinking on important global causes. Anecdotally, it feels like billionaires (Elon Musk, SBF, Bezos, Bill Gates to an extent) tend to be focused on longtermist causes like space exploration. It\u0026rsquo;s a fine and valuable, but I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical that it\u0026rsquo;s the optimal allocation.\nThird, does this really happen in practice? Probably not often.\nCause A vs Cause B\nSub choice 2 is between causes. I think causes are impossible to reason between because any unified framework that compares causes will have extremely wide error bands that make the comparison inconclusive\t.\nTake a classic example - global development aid versus minimizing existential risk. Let\u0026rsquo;s use the expected quality adjusted life years framework for both. This requires 3 ingredients: the number of people benefitted, the quality of life improvement for those benefitted, and the probability that the intervention works.\nGlobal development aid\n Number of people benefitted - known. Just take the population of countries in question. Quality of life improvement - very difficult to compute, many conceptions of quality and several unexpected interaction terms (e.g. will development aid result in the government underinvest in its own infrastructure?) Probability - more or less known if you choose a vetted charity with real research/randomized controlled trials backing the interventions.  Existential risk\n Number of people benefitted - mostly known. Under reasonable assumptions, you could extrapolate the number of people that survive based on how long humanity survives. This number is very very high. Quality of life improvement - basically throwing darts. Quality of life might be better than today given what we know about the past, but it could seriously turn for the worse in the long run. Who\u0026rsquo;s to say some dictator doesn\u0026rsquo;t take over the world in 500 years and kill everybody\u0026rsquo;s quality of life for the next 500? It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to reason out all the possibilities when you are thinking about the world 1,000 years in the future. Probability - hard to argue a particular intervention actually moves the needle. This is a rant for another time, but just because the intervention could possibly/concievably work does not mean it has a positive probability of working. You can have possible outcomes that have 0 probability (e.g. picking a random real number from a hat of numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1). If the intervention possibly works but probability is still 0, the expected benefit of the intervention is still 0.  You could do this comparison for several causes and end up in a spot with false precision - you\u0026rsquo;re multiplying/adding together numbers with extremely wide error bands. It\u0026rsquo;s not really any less subjective than choosing on vibes.\nManaging on an Impactful Company Some companies have materially changed the world (e.g. Azure/AWS efficient cloud computing, Tesla forcing the industry into EV\u0026rsquo;s), and maintaining material management rights over the firm requires potentially billions of dollars in stock. The key here then is the marginal benefit of a manager/planner requiring stock to make those decisions rather than an individual contributor producing the innovations where holding stock isn\u0026rsquo;t actually needed.\nI have two main objections to keeping stock to drive the direction of the company.\nFirst, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember the objective is to generally improve well being for the world rather than just the shareholders. So, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter who is providing the important services but rather that someone just does it. So, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to justify the marginal dollars kept/spent on taking decision rights from someone else that is probably perfectly capable of running the company. On the innovation side, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear why managers are the key driver over individual contributors coming up with ideas (that don\u0026rsquo;t need stock to do so).\nSecond, I think innovation is the main role corporations have in producing social benefits because old ideas generally get replicated and produced more cheaply via capitalist competition. Just from looking at the major companies throughout my lifetime, they aren\u0026rsquo;t doing that much in the innovation department and just come and go. I feel like it would be a lot more effective to tie up the capital driving the direction of multiple very innovative and disruptive startups.\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/longtermism/","summary":"SBF\u0026rsquo;s fraud does not implicate my conception of Effective Altruism because I do not think he was actually an effective altruist.","title":"In Defense of Effective Altruism after SBF"},{"content":"In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent way too long poring over \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; life decisions.

At first glance, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense - how could it be beneficial to overwork employees and then lay them off? Why not hire more (or less) to begin with? In this post I work out a simple profit-max problem showing that 1) imperfect forecasting of future dealflow and 2) sticky hiring make it optimal to overwork analysts during good times and underwork (+ fire) them during bad.\nIn subsequent blog posts, I\u0026rsquo;ll consider complications where there are Directors bringing in dealflow and Mid-Level (think Associate or VP) that manage analysts and make them scale better.\nBasic Setup Intuitively, the investment bank wants to choose hiring that maximizes expected revenues. Banks with a crystal ball would hire perfectly - unfortunately they can\u0026rsquo;t.\nMathematically, we say these are \u0026ldquo;constraints\u0026rdquo;\n Banks are uncertain about next year\u0026rsquo;s deaflow Banks can only pick hires one year in advance (no re-neging/cancelling of offers)  Mathematically this is expressed as the following optimization problem\n$$\\max_{\\ell_{t-1}} \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\underbrace{r\\min\\left( f\\left(\\ell_{t-1}\\right),D_{t}\\right) }_{\\text{Revenues}}-\\underbrace{w\\ell_{t-1}}_{\\text{Wages Paid}}\\right)$$\nWhere\n \\(f(\\ell)\\) is analyst productivity \\(D_t\\) is the number of deals \\(w\\) is wage \\(r\\) is the revenue made by the bank per deal  Revenues is the more complicated term. Intuitively, if there are too many deals, \\(D_t \u0026gt; f(\\ell_{t-1})\\), the firm could have hired more analysts to make more revenue. If there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough deals, \\(D_t \u0026lt; f(\\ell_{t-1})\\), the firm over hired and is wasting money on wages. That\u0026rsquo;s why total revenues is the minimum of the two.\n\\(D_t\\) is not known ahead of time but the firm can guess. Essentially, I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that good times are likely to continue and bad times are too. That being said, there\u0026rsquo;s still a nonzero chance that the times change.\nSolution Under reasonable assumptions, we get that the number of analysts hired looks like this: $$\\ell_{t-1}=\\frac{r\\cdot p_{\\text{good}}}{w}$$\nBut remember - \\(p_\\text{good}\\) will be high if we\u0026rsquo;re in a high dealflow state and will be low if we are in a low dealflow state.\nEconomically,\n Analyst hiring follows the dealflow (economic) cycle. The firm will fire analysts when we move from good deal flow to bad deal flow because bad times are likely to continue (reducing \\(p_\\text{good}\\)) The firm will hemorrage money in the low state, over hiring, in preparation for capturing more deal flow in the high state Analysts are over-worked in the high deal flow state because there are much more deals than analysts can work on  More Detail I typed this up like I would a problem set from university here\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/humanresources/","summary":"Motivated by recent news and conversations from friends, I solve a very simplistic microeconomic model showing why banks over work analysts in good times and fire in bad.","title":"The Investment Bank HR Problem"},{"content":"Set Up At the highest level, the basic problem for trip planning is presenting an idea to multiple stakeholders and requiring unanimous buy in. The rest is operational (e.g. booking flights, hotels, charging people, etc.).\nThis difficulty scales significantly with the number of people you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get on board.\nI think there are just two (conflicting) goals for trip planning\n Maximize attendance Achieve some specific itinerary (e.g. target a specific time - like the two weeks of off time you have between work projects - or target a specific location - like \u0026ldquo;I want to go to Europe\u0026rdquo;).  I think for both goals the conceptual map is the same, but the time spent and order for each step is slightly different\nGeneral Steps I\u0026rsquo;ll preface this by saying the plan is obvious.

You will have to annoy people to get the planning over the line - just tell yourself it\u0026rsquo;s for everyone\u0026rsquo;s good to do this and you won\u0026rsquo;t feel so bad being such a bother.\nThe explicit steps are\n Get in sync on the goal of the trip. If the goal is to maximize attendance:  Plan the date far-ish in advance (3-6mo). Takes 1-2 weeks. Plan the location/itinerary - generally some combination of cutting through by unliaterally picking stuff yourself and getting some suggestions from the group. Takes 1-2 weeks. Manage prerequisites (e.g. passports). Takes a few days to a week. Do the booking. Takes 1 day.   If the goal is to go somewhere cool  Pick the location and itinerary first Plan the date, roughly lining up with who would be most interested in the location Manage prerequisites. Takes a few days to a week. Do the booking. Takes 1 day.    Picking a date For picking a date, the most important thing is keeping organized and minimizing the number of back and forths. Delays will come from not being explicit in what you want people to say (e.g. preferences vs hard conflicts) and not providing enough options (so you have to send out additional polls).\nLay out a several options - more for bigger groups - and make them choose. If there are a lot of people (i.e. more than 5), you can\u0026rsquo;t really manage preferences so only have people list weeks/days they can\u0026rsquo;t go.\nPicking a location Within this sub-step there are 2 points\n Getting ideas Making people pick out of the ideas  Get ideas by just being a normal human being and talking to group members about what they want to do.

I\u0026rsquo;m primarly interested in the trading part of the business, which makes about 80-90% of their revenue.\nAt a high level, coinbase trading revenue is Revenue = RetailTransactionVolume * Fees\nTheir costs are in line with any other growthy tech business - lots of tech investment to build out the platform and lots of sales and marketing. In the last couple quarters they\u0026rsquo;ve substantially increased investment into the non-trading parts of the business.\nCurrent Pricing Correlation to BTC Price Right now, Coinbase is priced closely to BTC (its correlation to BTC is ~0.7, correlation to SPX is about ~0.5 over the last year). This naturally makes its market value deviate from \u0026lsquo;fundamental value\u0026rsquo; through time.\nWho trades the stock drives the correlation, which currently are investors looking for a broader \u0026ldquo;crypto\u0026rdquo; exposure rather than investing in Coinbase specifically. The top holders are Crypto or \u0026ldquo;Innovation\u0026rdquo; ETFs. This suggests that most investors invest in Coinbase through these ETF\u0026rsquo;s because they either cannot or will not invest in cryptocurrencies directly.\nA couple times, the pricing bucked the trend and fell more in line with fundamentals. For example, the 2022Q1 earnings report was a heavy \u0026ldquo;surprise\u0026rdquo; to the downside because Crypto volumes fell that quarter even though cryptocurrency prices rose significantly. The fact that volumes dropped YTD was no secret - it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see in any publically availble chart of cryptocurrency volumes.\nSince 80%+ of Coinbase revenue comes directly from cryptocurrency trading volumes, I think the \u0026lsquo;fundamental\u0026rsquo; value should be driven by trading volumes rather the prices themselves. Sure, there is some relationship between the two - normal people won\u0026rsquo;t be keen to open a coinbase account and trade when BTC is in a huge drawdown - but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it should be as strong as it is right now.\nFundamental Value Using a backwards DCF with very conservative assumptions (assuming the non-trading parts of the business generated 0 profits, heavy discount rate, and heavy discounting of crypto assets on their balance sheet), a $66 sh price of Coinbase implies that BTC volumes will be down 40% in the coming years.\nCatalyst I see two potential that could make Coinbase price more in line with its fundamentals rather than in line with the broader crypto market.\n Earnings - they report that revenue is up because volumes are up, causing the price to go up in the short term (but potentially revert in line with btc price). Market Players will Change - Within the next 1-2 years, there will be an increase in fundamental value investor coverage in this space which will make the price converge to be priced in line with volume rather than BTC price.  Final Note I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll actually buy in, but I thought this was an interesting case of market value pretty clearly deviating from fundamental value due to the current market conditions (i.e. who is trading the stock).\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/coinbase/","summary":"How the business works Coinbase has several lines of business with the goal of creating a crypto personal finance ecosystem (payments, investment, loans, credit, and a bunch more).

Since it is impractical to recover beliefs about every single stock, I collapse these individual stock holdings into 3 core factors (Market returns, Value returns, and Size returns) that are known to explain equity returns well.\nAssuming that the investors decide in accordance to mean-variance, I can estimate what they believe the mean market return is from how much of the market factor they are holding.\nI get the following 2 plots for the Mean and Standard Deviation of Investor Beliefs\nPlot 1 Plot 2 I interpret the mean belief as what the \u0026lsquo;average\u0026rsquo; investor in the sample thinks the respective factors will return, while the standard deviation of beliefs shows the amount of disagreement around the average that investors have.\nPessimism during crises Plot 1 shows that the Dot Com bubble and 2008 financial crisis (shown by vertical dotted lines) coincided with significant downturns in beliefs about market returns. Plot 2 shows that for the same crises, investor disagreement about returns increased.\nBeliefs don\u0026rsquo;t predict returns Plot 3 This scatterplot visualizes the average investor\u0026rsquo;s belief about market returns against actual returns. If the average investor was any good at predicting market returns, we would expect the points to closely align to the 45 degree line (dotted line above, where a 1% increase in belief is associated with a 1% increase in the actual market returns). Our estimates show there is basically no relationship between what the average investor believes the market will do and what actually happens.\nImplications for the CAPM The classic CAPM model: $$R_{i,t} = \\beta_i m_t + r_{f,t}$$ Where \\(R_{i,t}\\) is the expected return of stock \\(i\\), \\(\\beta_i\\) is the exposure of stock \\(i\\) to market risk, \\(m_t\\) is the return of the market portfolio, and \\(r_{f,t}\\) is the risk free rate.\nPredictive weakness in the classic CAPM led one branch of the asset pricing literature to generalize the classic model to include heterogeneous rather than uniform beliefs. By and large, these papers have the same prediction as the classic CAPM but replace the actual market portfolio return with what the average investor believes about the market portfolio return. This model has been tough to test in the past because we had no means of assessing what investors actually believe the market will return. Using the estimates from my paper, we can conduct a novel test of this previously untestable model.\nIf the consensus-belief CAPM is any good we would expect \\(\\gamma\\) in the following regression to equal 1: $$R_{i,t} - r_{f,t} = \\gamma[\\beta_i m_t] + e_t$$\nWhere \\(m_t\\) is what the average investor thinks the market will return at time \\(t\\), \\(R_{i,t}\\) is the actual return of stock \\(i\\), \\(\\beta_i\\) is the actual exposure of stock \\(i\\) to market risk, and \\(e_t\\) is the error term.\nPlot 4 We plot the \\(\\gamma\\) estimates through time along with ther 95% confidence bands, showing that they\u0026rsquo;re basically all over the place and significantly different from 1.\nThis comes from the fact that if the belief-driven CAPM is true, beliefs have to be predictive of actual returns. From plot 3, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the case - so our results suggest that the belief-driven CAPM doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the data.\nLink to Paper For a lot more technical details, discussion of limitations, and literature review, you can see my actual paper here\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/thesis/","summary":"In my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s honors thesis, I find that pessimism and disagreement increase during economic crises, that the average investor predicts returns very poorly, and that the data rejects a belief-driven CAPM model.","title":"Investor Beliefs and Asset Pricing"},{"content":"Summary  Judge assets on a risk-adjusted basis. Many managers get free press for “significantly beating the market”(20%-30% returns per year), these returns aren’t that special if their performance is a lot more volatile than the market. Diversification matters. A well-constructed portfolio can have a similar level return at a lower risk than the individual components of the portfolio. Good investing does not require taking bets (e.g. “I think GME will go down” or “I think inflation will go up”). The Mean-Variance approach to investing tells us that we can improve our portfolios even if we believe asset returns are random.  Definitions and Basic Facts Here, we will treat assets you are investing in as random variables. Why? Because it is notoriously difficult to know with any precision what a particular stock, bond, etc. will return next year. If you know what the stock market will return next year, you should close this article and open up your own hedge fund.\nDefinitions:\n Expected return means the average return of some asset or portfolio. We denote the expected return of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(E(X)\\) Volatility means the standard deviation of some asset or portfolio. We denote the variance of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(\\text{Var}(X)\\). The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. Correlation, between -1 and +1 describes a relationship between two assets. A -1 correlation means there is a perfect negative linear relationship, and a +1 correlation means there is a perfect positive linear relationship between the two assets. A more negative correlation means the assets diversify eachother well, because when one goes down the other is more likely to offset by going down.  Example 1: We can use the above facts to compute expected returns and volatility of a portfolio from their components. Let’s say \\(X\\) are stocks and \\(Y\\) are bonds. Your portfolio is one half stocks and another half bonds.\nFrom historical data, we can compute the below table\n   Asset Expected Return Risk (Standard Deviation) Ratio     American Stocks 6% 20% 0.3   American Bonds 2% 7% 0.23   Table 1: Stocks and Bonds       Let\u0026rsquo;s consider 2 cases -\n A realistic case - American Stocks and American Bonds historically have a correlation of -0.2 A less realistic case - assume they\u0026rsquo;re much more negatively correlated with a correlation of -0.8     Case Expected Return Risk (Standard Deviation) Ratio     Case 1 Portfolio 4% 10.6% 0.4   Case 2 Portfolio 4% 10.5% 0.4   Table 2: Returns and Risks of Simple 50-50 Portfolios       Notice two points:\n The Case 2 portfolio is strictly better than the case 1 portfolio, although not by much. Both portfolios have a better risk-return ratio than the assets individually.  This starts to show the benefits of diversification. By doing a simple combination, you can often get improvements (on a risk-adjusted basis) to the assets you start with.\nThe Importance of Risk Adjustment Why do we bother with risk adjustment? Here are two reasons:\nRisk aversion People are generally risk averse, so they must be paid in the form of superior average returns to take it. There are lots of empirical studies in Psychology demonstrating this; take a look at the Wiki Article on Prospect Theory for reference.\nAnother justification for risk aversion is the St. Petersburg Paradox. This provides an example of a wager with infinite expected value that nobody would realistically play for billions or trillions of dollars - because we risk losing everything.\nBorrowing In markets, return and risk can be scaled up or down with borrowing. Table 4 walks through a calculation with a base portfolio of $100 and borrowing $200 at a 2% interest rate from the bank. The investor invests everything (borrowed and initial) into the same asset that returned 5%.\n   Source Amount     Portfolio $100   Portfolio Return $5   Borrowing $200   Borrowed Return $10   Repay Bank -$200   Repay Bank Interest -$4   Total $111   Table 4a: Amplifying Returns with Borrowing     Since the investment went up 5%, the investor gained on their invested money and the borrowed money. This results in a net gain of 11% on their own money.\nIt works the other way too, the table looks a quite sad if the asset goes down 5%.\n   Source Amount     Portfolio $100   Portfolio Return -$5   Borrowing $200   Borrowed Return -$10   Repay Bank -$200   Repay Bank Interest -$4   Total $81   Table 4b: Amplifying Returns with Borrowing     In this way, if investors can easily borrow (true for large institutions, less true for you and me) - the expected return of an asset is almost meaningless. We can get any return we want with any asset by just borrowing money and reinvesting that borrowed money.\nThe Mean-Variance Approach to Investing In the stock bond example, we simplistically invested 50-50 and called it a day. In reality, we might choose a better asset-mix if that would give us a better portfolio.\nIn the mean-variance approach, there are 2 steps.\n Set a level of return we want Choose the portfolio that achieves that return at minimum risk.  Diversification Plots 2 through 5 show the desired level of portfolio return on the X axis and resulting optimal portfolio volatility on the Y axis. The solid line shows the risk/return characteristics of possible portfolios, while the dotted line shows the risk/return characteristics of optimal portfolios.\nBetter portfolios are closer to the bottom right (high return, low volatility).\n   Plot Number Asset 1 Return Asset 2 Return Asset 1 Risk Asset 2 Risk Correlation     2 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.0   3 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.9   4 5% 3% 30% 15% -0.9   5 5% -0.5% 30% 15% -0.9    Plot 2: In Plot 2, we can see some small benefits to diversification. Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the leftmost point - this means that we desire a return of 3.0%. There are 2 ways to achieve that return.\n The solid line shows that we can get 3.0% return by holding 0% of asset 1 and 100% of asest 2. This gives us a portfolio risk of 15%. The dotted line shows that we can get that 3.0% return by holding 25% of asset 1 and 75% of asset 2. This gives us a strictly better portfolio - it has a higher return (3.5%) and lower volatility (about 12%).  Geometrically, we can see this because the line of possible portfolios is u-shaped. The downward-sloping part of the U means we can get closer to the bottom right (higher return and lower risk) by increasing the weight of asset 1.\nSo, there are a lot of possible portfolios in this example that are simply not worth considering - the 0% asset 1 portfolio is one of them.\nPlot 3: In example 3, we have two highly correlated assets. Here, there are almost no benefits to diversification. The solid line of possible portfolios essentially coincides with the dotted line of optimal portfolios. This makes sense - because highly correlated assets are basically the same asset.\nPlot 4: In example 4, we have two highly negatively correlated assets. In this plot, we see the same features as in example 2 in a much more pronounced manner.\nPlot 5: Example 5 shows that there are some benefits to diversification even if one of the assets yields negative returns. But, the benefits only arise if you want a small portfolio return. This is why we buy insurance - we generally pay more in premiums than we will cash out on, but we still do so because it sufficiently reduces the risk we take on in life.\nLimitations of the Mean Variance Approach If you want to follow the model to the tee to invest your retirement portfolio, you have to know ahead of time the average returns for each stock and all of the covariances. That estimation task (particularly the covariances from time-dependent data) is notoriously difficult that it’s worth an entire research field in statistics and applied math.\nRisk-adjusted-return is not as actionable if you don’t have easy sources of borrowing. To increase the return of your portfolio, you would have to bias your portfolio towards stocks and reduce your gains from diversification.\nFor this reason, I am not automating my stock portfolio using this model but the key lessons are still relevant.\nAppendix - Some Math Facts: $$E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y)$$ $$\\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\text{Var}(X) + b^2\\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$\nThe Mean Variance Model $$\\min w^2Var(a_1)+(1−w)^2Var(a_2)$$ $$\\text{s.t. } wE(a_1) + (1-w) E(a_2) \\geq \\mu_0$$\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/portfolioselection/","summary":"Some of you might be interested in what finance theory has to say about saving and investing.

The dial-in process requires a ton of time, effort, and (now increasingly expensive\u0026hellip;) coffee. Ideally, you dial-in like a science experiment - change one variable and evaluate the output. The machine controls a ton of those variables: temperature of the water, temperature of the group, pressure, water dispersion, among other things. The BDB (not that special for a machine in its price point) is well known to manage all of the above quite consistently from brew to brew.\nThe fast heat up time actually broke the tie for me between the BDB and the other machines. Unbelievably, dual boilers that heat up in a reasonable amount of time are few and far between. This is because home machines, generally borrowing from their commercial counterparts, usually rely on having large boilers to heat up the group head passively or churn water through the group head. These are great at maintaining consistent temps in a relatively \u0026lsquo;stupid\u0026rsquo; and reliable manner, which probably cuts down on Cafe maintenance costs. This method is incredibly wasteful if you heat up a huge amount of water to brew 1 40ml shot of espresso.\nThe BDB is one of few that directly heat the group head electrically - here\u0026rsquo;s the design below (pretty neat).\nThe brew boiler (2) heats up relatively quickly because it\u0026rsquo;s small, and the group head (3) is heated directly via a coil.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard of other machines that do this - like the Bezzra BZ10.

I’ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.\nI’ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.\nPricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won’t have to buy it at full price ($80). At the time of writing, it went for $60 on Wayfair 4 times. You can also find it on Sweet Maria’s for $80 with 4lbs of free green beans included, worth \u0026gt;=$20. Product Explanation\nThe Nesco runs in 3 steps if you don’t interrupt it\n You put in the coffee \u0026amp; press the medium or dark button The roast cycle runs for 18 minutes (for both roast settings) The dark setting runs at a higher temperature The cool cycle runs for 2 minutes  Roasting Tips  Roast \u0026lt;3oz at a time. They recommend 4oz on the box, but I’ve found that the roast is very inconsistent with large batches I wouldn’t recommend using the Dark setting   The roasts are less consistent due to the higher earlier roast temperatures. Since the Nesco does not sufficiently agitate the coffee while roasting, the beans near the walls will be darker than the beans in the center. (This doesn’t happen if you roast for the full cycle) The medium roast on the full 18m cycle already goes well into a French Roast, so the dark setting seems like overkill If you can spare it, put your beans through a full roast cycle to get a sense of when each phase of the roast starts Check that the roaster is fully closed before roasting (lightly lift the cap and make sure the cap doesn’t come off) to avoid temperature loss  When I didn’t do this, the timings below could be off by more than 15 seconds. Since the roast develops very quickly after the first crack, this could easily throw your recipes off.   On average, these were the average timings for 4 different bean origins  14m40s-14m50s: short rolling first crack (popcorn sounds) - light roast, but not drinkable yet 15m20s-15m40s: longer rolling first crack (more popcorn sounds) - light medium to medium 16m20s-16m30s: short rolling second crack (snappy sounds) - medium to medium/dark roast 17m00s: long rolling second crack (loud snappy sounds) - french roast territory   I wouldn’t recommend roasting city roasts using this machine  I haven’t tasted crispness in coffees taken 15-30s after of first crack (explanation below) The Nesco raises the temperature of the roast chamber very slowly in order to roast evenly without having to power a huge fan that blows the raw coffee around in the early stages of the roast. This makes the machine cheap and easy to run, but you lose th eability to produce good light roasts.
