Look at a list of some apps here.\nThe Returns In summary, these apps allow you to lend cryptocurrencies to other participants on the platform at what look like unreasonably high APY. A quick look at OKEX, a popular defi exchange, shows that investors can earn 7.3% APY on Tether as of writing (a stablecoin pegged to USD).\nThe Risks These returns aren\u0026rsquo;t free. So-called \u0026ldquo;traditional centralized finance\u0026rdquo; lends at low rates but almost exclusively to creditworthy institutions and individuals (for better or worse). So, the low APY corresponds to low risk. If you turn to lending markets for people that have bad or no credit - notoriously Payday Loans - 7.3% APY looks competitive!\nI believe that 7.3% APY is compensation for substantial credit risk. For example, the same individuals qualifying only for Payday Loans or comparable sources of borrowing are also qualified to borrow in stablecoins, since anybody can download the app and borrow. Some investors borrow large quantities coins, convert to a higher yielding coin, and loan out that coin to get higher yields. (This is a crude explanation of yield farming strategies.) If those strategies go bust, the initial borrower can\u0026rsquo;t repay the loan.\nGiven that investors can get some return for risk they otherwise can\u0026rsquo;t access, it makes sense to have small amounts of it in an investment portfolio for the sake of diversification.\n","permalink":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/cryptopitch/","summary":"TLDR  Crypto is popular Investors can get high returns by lending out cryptocurrencies, but they take on credit risk and currency risk.

In this post I\u0026rsquo;ll cover a classic model for portfolio choice and what we can learn from it.\nTLDR  Judge assets on a risk-adjusted basis. Many managers get free press for \u0026ldquo;significantly beating the market\u0026rdquo;(20%-30% returns per year), these returns aren\u0026rsquo;t that special if their performance is a lot more volatile than the market. Diversification matters. A well-constructed portfolio can have a similar level return at a lower risk than the individual components of the portfolio. Good investing does not require taking bets (e.g. \u0026ldquo;I think GME will go down\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I think inflation will go up\u0026rdquo;). The Mean-Variance approach to investing tells us that we can improve our portfolios even if we believe asset returns are random.  Definitions and Basic Facts Here, we will treat assets you are investing in as random variables. Why? Because it is notoriously difficult to know with any precision what a particular stock, bond, etc. will return next year. If you know what the stock market will return next year, you should close this article and open up your own hedge fund.\nDefinitions:\n Expected return means the average return of some asset or portfolio. We denote the expected return of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(E(X)\\) Volatility means the standard deviation or variance of some asset or portfolio. We denote the volatility of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(\\text{Var}(X)\\)  Facts: $$E(aX + bY) = a E(X) + b E(Y)$$ $$\\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\text{Var}(X) + b^2\\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$\nExample 1:\nWe can use the above facts to compute expected returns and volatility of a portfolio from their components. Let\u0026rsquo;s say \\(X\\) are stocks and \\(Y\\) are bonds. Your portfolio is one half stocks and another half bonds.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do this more concretely:\n   Asset Expected Return Risk (Var) Cov(X,Y)     American Stocks 6% 0.09    American Bonds 2% 0.    Portfolio 4% - -   Table 1: Stocks and Bonds       Example 2:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take another example where we have two assets with the same return, same risk, and are uncorrelated.\n   Asset Expected Return Risk (SD) Cov(X,Y)     Asset 1 6% 30% 0   Asset 2 6% 30% 0   Portfolio 6% 21% -   Table 2: Hypothetical Example       Notice how the portfolio is strictly better than the individual assets. It has the same average return but \\(\\approx \\frac{2}{3}\\) the volatility; this is the magic of diversification.\nPlot 1 shows the general case where \\(a,b\\) can be any pair of nonnegative numbers summing to 1. The x-axis is the portfolio return, y axis is the portfolio volatility, and the color is the weight of asset 1. By adjusting the weights, we access the same average return of 5% but can achieve a volatility of as low as 21%.\nThe Importance of Risk Adjustment Why do we bother with risk adjustment? Here are two reasons:\nRisk aversion People are generally risk averse, so they must be paid in the form of superior average returns to take it. There are lots of empirical studies in Psychology demonstrating this; take a look at the Wiki Article on Prospect Theory for reference.\nAnother justification for risk aversion is the St. Petersburg Paradox. This provides an example of a wager with infinite expected value that nobody would realistically play for billions or trillions of dollars.\nBorrowing In markets, return and risk can be scaled up or down with borrowing. Table 4 walks through a calculation with a base portfolio of $100 and borrowing $200 at a 2% interest rate from the bank. For simplicity, all the money is invested into the same asset that returned 5%.\n   Source Amount     Portfolio $100   Portfolio Return $5   Borrowing $200   Borrowed Return $10   Repay Bank -$200   Repay Bank Interest -$4   Total $111   Table 4: Amplifying Returns with Borrowing     Since the investment went 5%, the investor gained on their invested money and the borrowed money. This results in a net gain of 11% on their own money.\nThe Model1 In this model, the investor chooses the portfolio \\(w\\) with lowest volatility meeting a required amount of return \\(\\mu_0\\).\n$$\\min_{w} w^2\\text{Var}(a_1) + (1-w)^2 \\text{Var}(a_2)$$ $$\\text{s.t. } wE(a_1) + (1-w) E(a_2) \\geq \\mu_0$$\nThe key intuition of the solution is that the optimal portfolio consists of two components. The first component is the minimum variance portfolio. The second component is the portfolio weighting assets based on the risk-return ratio (with adjustments for correlation across assets). This result tells us why risk-adjusted return matters so much when evaluating portfolios.\nNext I will show the solution to this model for various values of expected returns and volatilities.\nThe Value of Diversification    Number Asset 1 Return Asset 2 Return Asset 1 Risk Asset 2 Risk Correlation     2 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.0   3 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.9   4 5% 3% 30% 15% -0.9   5 5% -0.5% 30% 15% -0.9   Table 3: List of Asset Characteristics         In plots 2 through 5 I plot the required level of portfolio return and volatilites of all accessible portfolios (\\(0 \u0026lt; w_1 \u0026lt; 1\\)) in a line plot and the minimum volatility (optimal) portfolio meeting the minimum portfolio return requirement. The color range shows the value of \\(w_1\\), or the weight of Asset 1. In general, better portfolios are further to the right (greater return) and closer to the bottom (lower volatility).\nPlot 2: Here we have 2 uncorrelated assets, one with high returns \u0026amp; high volatility and one with low returns \u0026amp; low volatility.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that we have no access to leverage. Leverage is a means of scaling the returns and volatility of any portfolio. Even without leverage, there are some benefits to diversification because the line plot has a u-shape. Since the line plot goes down to the right as we increase \\(w_1\\), that shows we can access a strictly better portfolio by increasing \\(w_1\\) from zero. Since \\(w_1=0\\) corresponds to only holding asset 2, we can immediately see that forming a portfolio strictly beats asset 2.\nIf leverage is allowed, the benefits of diversification are even greater. Without portfolios, we can only access the two red straight line plots. That is, scaled versions of \\(w_1 = 0\\) and \\(w_1 = 1\\). These correspond to the red and green lines. If we form the portfolio with the best risk to return ratio by solving the optimal portfolio problem above, we get \\(w_1 = w^*\\) which is some number whatever. We can then scale up or down to get the blue line. Now the benefits are even more obvious, the blue line is closer to the bottom right than the other 2 lines at basically every point.\nPlot 2 with Leverage: In example 3, we have two highly correlated assets. Here, there are almost no benefits to diversification. The solid line of possible portfolios is not u-shaped, and it essentially coincides with the dotted line of optimal portfolios. Introducing leverage also shows that all 3 lines coincide. So, there are little to no benefits to diversification if the assets you have to chose from are very correlated. This makes sense - because highly correlated assets are basically the same asset.\nPlot 3: Plot 3 with Leverage: In example 4, we have two highly negatively correlated assets. In this plot, we see the same graphical features as in example 2 in a much more pronounced manner. If we introduce leverage, the optimal portfolio line (blah blah color) completely knocks the two individual assets out of the park. This shows us that the benefits to diversification are greatest when we have negatively correlated assets. Intuitively, you can think of negatively correlated assets as safe-haven assets that perform well when the stock market drops.\nPlot 4: Plot 4 with Leverage: Hopefully by now you can recognize when there are benefits to diversification. This brings up an interesting question. What if a diversifying asset actually has negative returns. Are there benefits to diversification then?\nPlot 5: Plot 5 with Leverage: Here we can see that assets with negative returns but diversifying have a role in the portfolio if our required level of return is sufficiently low. This reasoning relates to why some long-term investors hold commodities (such as corn or gold). Even though commoddities have low returns, they are considered negatively correlated to stocks and bonds because their prices rise with inflation2.\nLimitations of the Mean Variance Approach If you want to follow the model to the tee to invest your retirement portfolio, you have to know ahead of time the average returns for each stock and all of the covariances. That estimation task (particularly the covariances from time-dependent data) is notoriously difficult that it\u0026rsquo;s worth an entire research field in statistics and applied math.\nRisk-adjusted-return is not as actionable if you don\u0026rsquo;t have easy sources of borrowing. To increase the return of your portfolio, you would have to bias your portfolio towards stocks and reduce your gains from diversification.\nFor this reason, I am not automating my stock portfolio using this model but the key lessons are still relevant.\nDisclaimer (makes me feel more professional) The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.\nI thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time? This puzzle motivated me to investigate this phenomenon using some math and computation.\nAssumptions  Individuals have preferences which are independently and uniformly distributed among the set of all possible rational preferences The group preference is determined by a head-to-head method of voting. The group prefers \\(p_1\\) to \\(p_2\\) if in a head-to-head vote \\(p_1\\) gets more votes than \\(p_2\\).  Computational Procedure Here are the basic steps:\n Generate a random set of rational preferences (individuals that will vote) Generate a group preference by head to head voting Check if the group preference is \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; Repeat 1-3 200 times, and report the percentage of preferences which are rational  My solution to the problem is actually quite inefficient. There is probably a way to compute this algebraically using basic combinatorics, but I was too lazy. Plus, the computational solution to step 3 is actually related to some fundamental CS concepts.\nComputation Results The figure below shows the estimated percent of consistent preferences. Yellow means almost 100% chance of consistent preferences, green means about 67%, blue 33%, and purple 0%.\nIncreasing the number of policies has the greatest effect on the percent of consistent group preferences. By the time the group is considering 9 different alternatives, the percentage of consistent preferences is essentially zero. Increasing number of people seems to only have a weak effect.\nA Specific Example of Inconsistent Group Preference What causes the inconsistency? I hope this example will be illustrative.\nFigure 1 shows a network representation of the group\u0026rsquo;s preferences. We draw an arrow from 1 -\u0026gt; 2 if the group prefers 1 to 2. Here we can see a clear cycle between 5, 2, and 1. This violates preference transitivity, because the group prefers 5 to 2 and 2 to 1, but does not prefer 5 to 1.\nThe reason behind the cycle is quite intuitive. Table 1 shows that a different \u0026ldquo;majority\u0026rdquo; voted for each pairwise competition. This kind of behavior happens all the time when there is imperfect intersection of interest groups.\nFigure 1: Network of Group Preferences Table 1: Table of Majorities (in the Cycle)\n   First Option Second Option Voters     5 2 A, B   1 2 A, C   1 5 B, C    To contrast rational preferences with inconsistent preferences, I\u0026rsquo;ve also included a network representation of voter A in figure 2. For voter A, each option has a different number of arrows pointing to it. This closely relates to ranked list preference: the best option has arrows pointing everywhere else, second best preferred has arrows pointing everywhere except the best, et cetera. This does not hold in Figure 1, as choices 5, 2 and 1 all have 2 arrows pointing into them.\nFigure 2: Network of Voter A\u0026rsquo;s Preferences I\u0026rsquo;ve also the list of individual ranked preferences generating figure 1 in Table 2 (at the end of the post).\nImplications for Voting In cases where the number of alternatives is small, we get consistent group preferences most of the time. So when voting between 3 or 4 alternatives (e.g. the presidential election, senate \u0026amp; house races, where to eat dinner), there really isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a problem.\nHowever, there are plenty of cases where the number of alternatives is pretty high. For example, legislators consider hundreds of different policies. This model of voting tells us it is very unlikely that the legislators as a group have rational preferences. So, the outcome of the vote depends a lot on voting rules and other mechanics of how the vote is conducted.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Assumption Relaxation. The model and its predictions are only as good as its assumptions. In my next blog post about Condorcet\u0026rsquo;s Paradox, I will try relaxing assumption 1 (that individuals are independently and uniformly distributed over the set of rational preferences).\nAfter all, seems nonsensical to assume that individuals form their beliefs independently. The fact that people regularly interact, consume similar media and information probably suggests that people have pretty correlated beliefs.\nFurthermore, peoples' preferences probably aren\u0026rsquo;t uniformly distributed over the space of policies. I would expect that the preferences are pretty clustered. For example, legislators identifying as \u0026lsquo;fiscal conservatives\u0026rsquo; probably rate all kinds of welfare spending at the bottom of their preference list. It would be rather strange if a senator put childcare spending first and then education spending last. But this model implies that such a lawmaker is fairly common!\nThis also isn\u0026rsquo;t original research. There are plenty of papers on this topic which I include at the end of the post (which I\u0026rsquo;ve read to varying degrees of completeness).\nThe Math Notation and Definitions Notation: let \\(I\\) be the set of individuals, \\(P\\) the set of policies under consideration, let \\( \u0026gt;_{i} \\) be the preference relation for person \\(i\\in I\\), and \\(\u0026gt;_g\\) be the preference relation for the group\nDefinition of Rationality:\nWe say that a preference relation \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) over a finite set of policies \\(P\\) is rational if \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) satisfies the following\n \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) is complete: For every \\(p_1, p_2 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_2, p_1 \\tilde{=} p_2, \\text{ or } p_1 \\tilde{\u0026lt;} p_2\\) \\(\\tilde{\u0026gt;}\\) is transitive: For every \\(p_1, p_2, p_3 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_2 \\text{ and } p_2 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_3 \\implies p_1 \\tilde{\u0026gt;} p_3\\)  Definition of \\(\u0026gt;_g\\):\nFor any \\(p_1, p_2 \\in P\\) we have that \\(p_1 \u0026gt;_g p_2\\) iff \\(|\\{i: p_1 \u0026gt;_i p_2\\}| \u0026gt; \\frac{|P|}{2}\\)\nAsssumptions The key assumption is that individual preferences are independently and uniformly distributed over the set of possible rational preferences.\nUniformity means that, if \\(S_p\\) is the set of possible rational preferences over \\(p\\), then the odds of a n individual having preference ordering (\u0026gt;_i) is given by $$\\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_i) = \\frac{1}{|S_p|}$$\nIndependence means that for any set of preference relations \\(\u0026gt;_1, \u0026hellip;, \u0026gt;_n\\) we have that $$\\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_1, \\dots, \u0026gt;_n) = \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_1) \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_2) \u0026hellip; \\text{Prob}(\u0026gt;_n) $$\nFor the purposes of this exercise, I represent a rational preference relation by a permutation on \\(P\\). This permutation shows the ranked preference of the individual.2\nDetermining if a preference relation is \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; Earlier I alluded to the connection between preferences and a \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; (or a Graph, in Computer Science). The definition of rational preferences is secretly the definition of a total ordering over a set. So, checking whether a group preference is rational simply amounts to checking if the group preference is a total ordering over the policy choice set.\nI talked to my more computationally-talented friends, and a simple way to solve this problem is to encode the preference into a directed graph with an edge i-\u0026gt;j if i is preferred to j. Then, check whether the directed graph has a cycle.3\nAdditional Figures and Tables List of Individual Preferences\n   Preference A Preference B Preference C     3 2 5   2 4 2   4 5 1   1 1 4   5 3 3    Network of Voter B\u0026rsquo;s Preferences Network of Voter C\u0026rsquo;s Preferences Additional Articles Tangian, A.

My next few blog posts will cover a few topics I found interesting.","title":"Analyzing Politics Review"},{"content":"About Me Hi Everyone!

I\u0026rsquo;ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.\nPricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won\u0026rsquo;t have to buy it at full price ($80). At the time of writing, it went for $60 on Wayfair 4 times. You can also find it on Sweet Maria\u0026rsquo;s for $80 with 4lbs of free green beans included, worth \u0026gt;=$20.\nProduct Explanation The Nesco runs in 3 steps if you don\u0026rsquo;t interrupt it\n You put in the coffee \u0026amp; press the medium or dark button The roast cycle runs for 18 minutes (for both roast settings)  The dark setting runs at a higher temperature   The cool cycle runs for 2 minutes  Roasting Tips  Roast \u0026lt;3oz at a time. They recommend 4oz on the box, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the roast is very inconsistent with large batches I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend using the Dark setting  The roasts are less consistent due to the higher earlier roast temperatures. Since the Nesco does not sufficiently agitate the coffee while roasting, the beans near the walls will be darker than the beans in the center. (This doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen if you roast for the full cycle) The medium roast on the full 18m cycle already goes well into a French Roast, so the dark setting seems like overkill   If you can spare it, put your beans through a full roast cycle to get a sense of when each phase of the roast starts Check that the roaster is fully closed before roasting (lightly lift the cap and make sure the cap doesn\u0026rsquo;t come off) to avoid temperature loss  When I didn\u0026rsquo;t do this, the timings below could be off by more than 15 seconds. Since the roast develops very quickly after the first crack, this could easily throw your recipes off.   On average, these were the average timings for 4 different bean origins  14m40s-14m50s: short rolling first crack (popcorn sounds) - light roast, but not drinkable yet 15m20s-15m40s: longer rolling first crack (more popcorn sounds) - light medium to medium 16m20s-16m30s: short rolling second crack (snappy sounds) - medium to medium/dark roast 17m00s: long rolling second crack (loud snappy sounds) - french roast territory   I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend roasting city roasts using this machine  I haven\u0026rsquo;t tasted crispness in coffees taken 15-30s after of first crack (explanation below) The Nesco raises the temperature of the roast chamber very slowly in order to roast evenly without having to power a huge fan that blows the raw coffee around in the early stages of the roast. This makes the machine cheap and easy to run, but you lose th eability to produce good light roasts.
