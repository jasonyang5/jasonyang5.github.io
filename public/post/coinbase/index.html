I’m primarly interested in the trading part of the business, which makes about 80-90% of their revenue.\nAt a high level, coinbase trading revenue is Revenue = RetailTransactionVolume * Fees\nTheir costs are in line with any other growthy tech business - lots of tech investment to build out the platform and lots of sales and marketing. In the last couple quarters they’ve substantially increased investment into the non-trading parts of the business.\nCurrent Pricing Correlation to BTC Price Right now, Coinbase is priced closely to BTC (its correlation to BTC is ~0.7, correlation to SPX is about ~0.5 over the last year). This naturally makes its market value deviate from ‘fundamental value’ through time.\nWho trades the stock drives the correlation, which currently are investors looking for a broader “crypto” exposure rather than investing in Coinbase specifically. The top holders are Crypto or “Innovation” ETFs. This suggests that most investors invest in Coinbase through these ETF’s because they either cannot or will not invest in cryptocurrencies directly.\nA couple times, the pricing bucked the trend and fell more in line with fundamentals. For example, the 2022Q1 earnings report was a heavy “surprise” to the downside because Crypto volumes fell that quarter even though cryptocurrency prices rose significantly. The fact that volumes dropped YTD was no secret - it’s easy to see in any publically availble chart of cryptocurrency volumes.\nSince 80%+ of Coinbase revenue comes directly from cryptocurrency trading volumes, I think the ‘fundamental’ value should be driven by trading volumes rather the prices themselves. Sure, there is some relationship between the two - normal people won’t be keen to open a coinbase account and trade when BTC is in a huge drawdown - but I don’t think it should be as strong as it is right now.\nFundamental Value Using a backwards DCF with very conservative assumptions (assuming the non-trading parts of the business generated 0 profits, heavy discount rate, and heavy discounting of crypto assets on their balance sheet), a $66 sh price of Coinbase implies that BTC volumes will be down 40% in the coming years.\nCatalyst I see two potential that could make Coinbase price more in line with its fundamentals rather than in line with the broader crypto market.\n Earnings - they report that revenue is up because volumes are up, causing the price to go up in the short term (but potentially revert in line with btc price). Market Players will Change - Within the next 1-2 years, there will be an increase in fundamental value investor coverage in this space which will make the price converge to be priced in line with volume rather than BTC price.  Final Note I’m not sure if I’ll actually buy in, but I thought this was an interesting case of market value pretty clearly deviating from fundamental value due to the current market conditions (i.e. who is trading the stock).\n","wordCount":"512","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/Coinbase.svg.png","datePublished":"2022-05-29T10:48:39-05:00","dateModified":"2022-05-29T10:48:39-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/coinbase/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jason's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a>
