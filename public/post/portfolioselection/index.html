In this post I’ll cover a classic model for portfolio choice and what we can learn from it.\nTLDR  Judge assets on a risk-adjusted basis. Many managers get free press for “significantly beating the market”(20%-30% returns per year), these returns aren’t that special if their performance is a lot more volatile than the market. Diversification matters. A well-constructed portfolio can have a similar level return at a lower risk than the individual components of the portfolio. Good investing does not require taking bets (e.g. “I think GME will go down” or “I think inflation will go up”). The Mean-Variance approach to investing tells us that we can improve our portfolios even if we believe asset returns are random.  Definitions and Basic Facts Here, we will treat assets you are investing in as random variables. Why? Because it is notoriously difficult to know with any precision what a particular stock, bond, etc. will return next year. If you know what the stock market will return next year, you should close this article and open up your own hedge fund.\nDefinitions:\n Expected return means the average return of some asset or portfolio. We denote the expected return of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(E(X)\\) Volatility means the standard deviation or variance of some asset or portfolio. We denote the volatility of an asset \\(X\\) as \\(\\text{Var}(X)\\)  Facts: $$E(aX + bY) = a E(X) + b E(Y)$$ $$\\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\text{Var}(X) + b^2\\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$\nExample 1:\nWe can use the above facts to compute expected returns and volatility of a portfolio from their components. Let’s say \\(X\\) are stocks and \\(Y\\) are bonds. Your portfolio is one half stocks and another half bonds.\nLet’s do this more concretely:\n   Asset Expected Return Risk (Var) Cov(X,Y)     American Stocks 6% 0.09    American Bonds 2% 0.    Portfolio 4% - -   Table 1: Stocks and Bonds       Example 2:\nLet’s take another example where we have two assets with the same return, same risk, and are uncorrelated.\n   Asset Expected Return Risk (SD) Cov(X,Y)     Asset 1 6% 30% 0   Asset 2 6% 30% 0   Portfolio 6% 21% -   Table 2: Hypothetical Example       Notice how the portfolio is strictly better than the individual assets. It has the same average return but \\(\\approx \\frac{2}{3}\\) the volatility; this is the magic of diversification.\nPlot 1 shows the general case where \\(a,b\\) can be any pair of nonnegative numbers summing to 1. The x-axis is the portfolio return, y axis is the portfolio volatility, and the color is the weight of asset 1. By adjusting the weights, we access the same average return of 5% but can achieve a volatility of as low as 21%.\nThe Importance of Risk Adjustment Why do we bother with risk adjustment? Here are two reasons:\nRisk aversion People are generally risk averse, so they must be paid in the form of superior average returns to take it. There are lots of empirical studies in Psychology demonstrating this; take a look at the Wiki Article on Prospect Theory for reference.\nAnother justification for risk aversion is the St. Petersburg Paradox. This provides an example of a wager with infinite expected value that nobody would realistically play for billions or trillions of dollars.\nBorrowing In markets, return and risk can be scaled up or down with borrowing. Table 4 walks through a calculation with a base portfolio of $100 and borrowing $200 at a 2% interest rate from the bank. For simplicity, all the money is invested into the same asset that returned 5%.\n   Source Amount     Portfolio $100   Portfolio Return $5   Borrowing $200   Borrowed Return $10   Repay Bank -$200   Repay Bank Interest -$4   Total $111   Table 4: Amplifying Returns with Borrowing     Since the investment went 5%, the investor gained on their invested money and the borrowed money. This results in a net gain of 11% on their own money.\nThe Model1 In this model, the investor chooses the portfolio \\(w\\) with lowest volatility meeting a required amount of return \\(\\mu_0\\).\n$$\\min_{w} w^2\\text{Var}(a_1) + (1-w)^2 \\text{Var}(a_2)$$ $$\\text{s.t. } wE(a_1) + (1-w) E(a_2) \\geq \\mu_0$$\nThe key intuition of the solution is that the optimal portfolio consists of two components. The first component is the minimum variance portfolio. The second component is the portfolio weighting assets based on the risk-return ratio (with adjustments for correlation across assets). This result tells us why risk-adjusted return matters so much when evaluating portfolios.\nNext I will show the solution to this model for various values of expected returns and volatilities.\nThe Value of Diversification    Number Asset 1 Return Asset 2 Return Asset 1 Risk Asset 2 Risk Correlation     2 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.0   3 5% 3% 30% 15% 0.9   4 5% 3% 30% 15% -0.9   5 5% -0.5% 30% 15% -0.9   Table 3: List of Asset Characteristics         In plots 2 through 5 I plot the required level of portfolio return and volatilites of all accessible portfolios (\\(0 Plot 2: Here we have 2 uncorrelated assets, one with high returns \u0026 high volatility and one with low returns \u0026 low volatility.\nFirst, let’s assume that we have no access to leverage. Leverage is a means of scaling the returns and volatility of any portfolio. Even without leverage, there are some benefits to diversification because the line plot has a u-shape. Since the line plot goes down to the right as we increase \\(w_1\\), that shows we can access a strictly better portfolio by increasing \\(w_1\\) from zero. Since \\(w_1=0\\) corresponds to only holding asset 2, we can immediately see that forming a portfolio strictly beats asset 2.\nIf leverage is allowed, the benefits of diversification are even greater. Without portfolios, we can only access the two red straight line plots. That is, scaled versions of \\(w_1 = 0\\) and \\(w_1 = 1\\). These correspond to the red and green lines. If we form the portfolio with the best risk to return ratio by solving the optimal portfolio problem above, we get \\(w_1 = w^*\\) which is some number whatever. We can then scale up or down to get the blue line. Now the benefits are even more obvious, the blue line is closer to the bottom right than the other 2 lines at basically every point.\nPlot 2 with Leverage: In example 3, we have two highly correlated assets. Here, there are almost no benefits to diversification. The solid line of possible portfolios is not u-shaped, and it essentially coincides with the dotted line of optimal portfolios. Introducing leverage also shows that all 3 lines coincide. So, there are little to no benefits to diversification if the assets you have to chose from are very correlated. This makes sense - because highly correlated assets are basically the same asset.\nPlot 3: Plot 3 with Leverage: In example 4, we have two highly negatively correlated assets. In this plot, we see the same graphical features as in example 2 in a much more pronounced manner. If we introduce leverage, the optimal portfolio line (blah blah color) completely knocks the two individual assets out of the park. This shows us that the benefits to diversification are greatest when we have negatively correlated assets. Intuitively, you can think of negatively correlated assets as safe-haven assets that perform well when the stock market drops.\nPlot 4: Plot 4 with Leverage: Hopefully by now you can recognize when there are benefits to diversification. This brings up an interesting question. What if a diversifying asset actually has negative returns. Are there benefits to diversification then?\nPlot 5: Plot 5 with Leverage: Here we can see that assets with negative returns but diversifying have a role in the portfolio if our required level of return is sufficiently low. This reasoning relates to why some long-term investors hold commodities (such as corn or gold). Even though commoddities have low returns, they are considered negatively correlated to stocks and bonds because their prices rise with inflation2.\nLimitations of the Mean Variance Approach If you want to follow the model to the tee to invest your retirement portfolio, you have to know ahead of time the average returns for each stock and all of the covariances. That estimation task (particularly the covariances from time-dependent data) is notoriously difficult that it’s worth an entire research field in statistics and applied math.\nRisk-adjusted-return is not as actionable if you don’t have easy sources of borrowing. To increase the return of your portfolio, you would have to bias your portfolio towards stocks and reduce your gains from diversification.\nFor this reason, I am not automating my stock portfolio using this model but the key lessons are still relevant.\nDisclaimer (makes me feel more professional) The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

Even without leverage, there are some benefits to diversification because the line plot has a u-shape. Since the line plot goes down to the right as we increase \(w_1\), that shows we can access a strictly better portfolio by increasing \(w_1\) from zero. Since \(w_1=0\) corresponds to only holding asset 2, we can immediately see that forming a portfolio strictly beats asset 2.</p><p>If leverage is allowed, the benefits of diversification are even greater. Without portfolios, we can only access the two red straight line plots. That is, scaled versions of \(w_1 = 0\) and \(w_1 = 1\). These correspond to the red and green lines.
If we form the portfolio with the best risk to return ratio by solving the optimal portfolio problem above, we get \(w_1 = w^*\) which is some number whatever. We can then scale up or down to get the blue line.
Now the benefits are even more obvious, the blue line is closer to the bottom right than the other 2 lines at basically every point.</p><p>Plot 2 with Leverage:
<img loading=lazy src=plot_lev2.png alt="Plot 2 with Leverage"></p><p>In example 3, we have two highly correlated assets. Here, there are almost no benefits to diversification. The solid line of possible portfolios is not u-shaped, and it essentially coincides with the dotted line of optimal portfolios. Introducing leverage also shows that all 3 lines coincide.
So, there are little to no benefits to diversification if the assets you have to chose from are very correlated. This makes sense - because highly correlated assets are basically the same asset.</p><p>Plot 3:

<img loading=lazy src=plot_lev3.png alt="Plot 3 with Leverage"></p><p>In example 4, we have two highly negatively correlated assets. In this plot, we see the same graphical features as in example 2 in a much more pronounced manner. If we introduce leverage, the optimal portfolio line (blah blah color) completely knocks the two individual assets out of the park. This shows us that the benefits to diversification are greatest when we have negatively correlated assets. Intuitively, you can think of negatively correlated assets as safe-haven assets that perform well when the stock market drops.</p><p>Plot 4:

<img loading=lazy src=plot_lev4.png alt="Plot 4 with Leverage"></p><p>Hopefully by now you can recognize when there are benefits to diversification. This brings up an interesting question. What if a diversifying asset actually has <em>negative</em> returns. Are there benefits to diversification then?</p><p>Plot 5:

<img loading=lazy src=plot_lev5.png alt="Plot 4 with Leverage"></p><p>Here we can see that assets with negative returns but diversifying have a role in the portfolio if our required level of return is sufficiently low.
This reasoning relates to why some long-term investors hold commodities (such as corn or gold). Even though commoddities have low returns, they are considered negatively correlated to stocks and bonds because their prices rise with inflation<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=limitations-of-the-mean-variance-approach>Limitations of the Mean Variance Approach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#limitations-of-the-mean-variance-approach>#</a></h2><p>If you want to follow the model to the tee to invest your retirement portfolio, you have to <em>know ahead of time</em> the average returns for each stock and all of the covariances.
