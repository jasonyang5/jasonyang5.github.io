      <description>I was surprised to find a bag of beans from Ethiopia Yirgacheffe roasted yesterday at a local roastery (Kusanya Cafe) at Whole Foods. The beans had a very smooth mouthfeel and were very bright and fruity.
I tried V60 first with the tabbed &amp;amp; bleached paper filters. The coffee felt quite thin but definitely not lacking in personality.
The Clever Dripper with a cloth filter tasted similar but had a much fuller body (which I personally prefer) because of the additional dissolved oils.</description>
