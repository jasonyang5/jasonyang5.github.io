      <title>Condorcet&#39;s Paradox in Political Science (Part 1)</title>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Condorcet Paradox&amp;rdquo; in political science observes that even if the preferences of all the individuals in some society are &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo;, the preferences of the group may not be1. Furthermore, the probability that irrational group preferences arise increase as the number of voters and number of policies under consideration become large.
I thought this result was rather unintuitive. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of voting if group preferences are inconsistent a lot of the time?</description>

      <title>Analyzing Politics Review</title>

      <description>General Impressions Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book called &amp;ldquo;Analyzing Politics&amp;rdquo; by Kenneth A Shepsle, which introduces rational models in political science. Rational models seek to explain political behavior (e.g. group voting, legislation, etc.) using individuals with &amp;ldquo;rational preferences&amp;rdquo;. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve waded through an economics major, I felt at home with this book&amp;rsquo;s treatment of the subject. My next few blog posts will cover a few topics I found interesting.</description>

      <title>Local Ethiopia Yirgacheffe</title>

      <description>I was surprised to find a bag of beans from Ethiopia Yirgacheffe roasted yesterday at a local roastery (Kusanya Cafe) at Whole Foods. The beans had a very smooth mouthfeel and were very bright and fruity.
I tried V60 first with the tabbed &amp;amp; bleached paper filters. The coffee felt quite thin but definitely not lacking in personality.
The Clever Dripper with a cloth filter tasted similar but had a much fuller body (which I personally prefer) because of the additional dissolved oils.</description>

      <title>Nesco Roasting Guide and Review</title>
      <link>https://jasonyang5.github.io/public/post/nesco/</link>

      <description>I got a great deal on a Nesco roaster ($45 for an open-box product, normally $80) and figured it would be great value at that price. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this roaster ~50 times, which should be enough to comment a bit on a very simple machine.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as I collect more data and learn new things about the roaster.
Pricing If you want to buy a Nesco, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to buy it at full price ($80).</description>
